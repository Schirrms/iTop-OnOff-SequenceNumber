# iTop-OnOff-SequenceNumber
Add a OnOff sequencement numeric field on our CMDB 

As for many organisation, we always struggle to stop and start (part of) our datacenter in the good order. Trought the years, one solution was set-up here : Each equipment has a "OnOff sequence number'. The higher the number is, sooner is the equipement stopped. Ans, of course, later is that equipment powered on at restart.

In short : we stop all 999 then all 998 ... and, when we reach 0, we can actually power down trhe datacenter (if this is the goal)

Throught this extension, we are now able to manage our OnOff sequence.
